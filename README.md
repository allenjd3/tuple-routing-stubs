# Adds Tuple Routing Stubs

I recommend you use this with laravel 5.6 or above.

to install-

    composer require allenjd3/tuple-routing-stubs

The package should be autodescovered. 

## To run the command-

    php artisan stub:tuple

warning: this action will change RouteServiceProvider.php and routes/web.php. Any previous changes will be lost so I recommend only using this on fresh installs.

note: laravel-ui is recommended for auth routes mainly for the auth controllers.
